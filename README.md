## Description: 
A rather complex employee management tool (WIP). It was designed to take CLI input and generate a webpage displaying your employee roster separated by position. Managers would be listed in their category, engineers in theirs, and so on. You would also be able to see each employees name, id, email, and unique info based off of their job.
